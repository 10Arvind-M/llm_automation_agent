### Step 4: Test the application

Run the application locally to ensure it works as expected.

```sh
export USER_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
python app.py
```

You can now call the endpoints to test the functionality.

### Step 5: Build and run the Docker image

Build the Docker image and run it.

```sh
docker build -t llm_automation_agent .
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 llm_automation_agent
```

You can now access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

This setup provides a basic structure for the automation agent. You can extend the `handle_task` function in `handlers.py` to include more task handlers as described in the prompt.
